# Email 

You will need an email account to send and receive emails from. Google apps for
domains or a gmail address tend to be good options that allow you to use their
smtp servers for sending, and are relatively well trusted by other email
providers. 

# Stripe 

This software uses Stripe for payment processing. Stripe has certain features
that we leverage that you can specify yourself. 

- under `https://manage.stripe.com/account` under 'settings,' select the option
  to "Decline charges that fail the CVC verification" and "Decline charges
  that fail the zip verification" for extra security.

# SSL Certificate

- you need an SSL certificate to take payments.
